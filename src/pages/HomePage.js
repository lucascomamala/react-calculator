    <h2>Brief history on the calculator:</h2>
    <p>
      An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculat
      ions, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

      The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized de
      vices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocess
      or, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom.

      Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturd
      y desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorpo
      ration of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices
      had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became co
      mmon in schools.
